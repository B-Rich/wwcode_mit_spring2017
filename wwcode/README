My solutions of problems from Sunday's Lectures

LECTURE 3-4:
Strings and Fuctions

Task 1:
	1. Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. 
	Use the if-then-else construct available in Python. (It is true that Python has the max() function built in, 
	but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)
	2. Define a function max_of_three() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
	3. Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string. 
	(It is true that Python has the len() function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)

Task 2:
	1. Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example,
	reverse("I am testing") should return the string "gnitset ma I".
	2. Define a function is_palindrome() that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same written backwards).
	For example, is_palindrome("radar") should return True.
	3. Write a function is_member() that takes a value (i.e. a number, string, etc) x and a list of values a,
	and returns True if x is a member of a, False otherwise. (Note that this is exactly what the in operator does,
	but for the sake of the exercise you should pretend Python did not have this operator.)
