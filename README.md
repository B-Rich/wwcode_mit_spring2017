# wwcode_mit_spring2017
My first step in programming and using git with MIT course "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python" and with WWCodeKyiv

wwcode - my solutions of problems from Sunday's Lecture_2

ps0.py - my solution of MIT PS0: this is a program that does the following in order:
                              1. Asks the user to enter a number “x”
                              2. Asks the user to enter a number “y”
                              3. Prints out number “x”, raised to the power “y”.
                              4. Prints out the log (base 2) of “x
